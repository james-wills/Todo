# Todo

This is a simple Todo app made for Codepath's Android class.

At the moment it does not include any extra features beyond what was required, but I plan on implementing some of them tomorrow.

Extra features:

- TodoItems are persisted in a SugarReccord SQLite db.
- Used a custom adapter to display custom row styles for each todo item
- Added priorities to each TodoItem
